# myPortfolio

Git Hub pages link: https://josephmmead.github.io/myPortfolio/

## HTML files

Attached you will find three HTML documents each containing once seperate page of my portfolio.

The first is my About Me page where you will find information the who I am

The second is a portfolio page which includes photos of a recent trip abroad. 

Lastly is the contact me page where you are able to contact me. 

Each page has a working Nav bar and footer with included social media links. 

## CSS files

There are two stylesheets attached to this project, the first being a reset.css sheet to cancel out any browser generated styling.

The second is my main style sheet that works with all three HTML sheets.

## last thoughts

I hope you enjoy my Portfolio page. I had alot of fun working on this. It really made me realize how little I know, but also how far I have come with just three weeks of experiance. 

Thank you!
